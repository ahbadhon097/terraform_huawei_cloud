# huaweicloud_dcs_redis_instance

Manages a DCS redis instance resource within HuaweiCloud.
This is an alternative to `huaweicloud_dcs_instance`.

## Example Usage

### Single Instance

```hcl
variable az_code {}
variable vpc_id {}
variable subnet_id {}

resource "huaweicloud_dcs_redis_instance" "redis_single" {
  name               = "redis_name"
  engine_version     = "5.0"
  capacity           = 0.125
  resource_spec_code = "redis.ha.xu1.tiny.r2.128"
  available_zones    = [var.az]
  vpc_id             = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id          = var.subnet_id
  password           = "YourPassword_123"

  charging_mode = "prePaid"
  period_unit   = "month"
  auto_renew    = "true"
  period        = "1"

  whitelists {
    group_name = "group_1"
    ip_address = ["192.168.1.0/24"]
  }
}
```

### Master/Standby Instance with Backup Policy

```hcl
variable primary_az {}
variable standby_az {}
variable vpc_id {}
variable subnet_id {}

resource "huaweicloud_dcs_redis_instance" "redis_master_standby" {
  name               = "redis_name"
  engine_version     = "5.0"
  capacity           = 4
  resource_spec_code = "redis.ha.xu1.large.r2.4"
  available_zones    = [var.primary_az, var.standby_az]
  vpc_id             = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id          = var.subnet_id
  password           = "YourPassword_123"

  charging_mode = "prePaid"
  period_unit   = "month"
  auto_renew    = "true"
  period        = "1"

  backup_policy {
    backup_type     = "auto"
    save_days       = 5

## Import

DCS redis instance can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
