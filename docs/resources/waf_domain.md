# huaweicloud_waf_domain

Manages a WAF domain resource within HuaweiCloud.

-> **NOTE:** All WAF resources depend on WAF instances, and the WAF instances need to be purchased before they can be
used. The domain name resource can be used in Cloud Mode.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "enterprise_project_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_certificate" "certificate_1" {
  name                  = "cert_1"
  enterprise_project_id = var.enterprise_project_id
  
  certificate = <<EOT

}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_domain" "domain_1" {
  domain                = "www.example.com"
  certificate_id        = huaweicloud_waf_certificate.certificate_1.id
  certificate_name      = huaweicloud_waf_certificate.certificate_1.name
  proxy                 = true
  enterprise_project_id = var.enterprise_project_id

  server {
    client_protocol = "HTTPS"
    server_protocol = "HTTP"
    address         = "119.8.0.13"
    port            = "8080"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the WAF domain resource. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this setting will push a new certificate.

* `domain` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the domain name to be protected. For example, `www.example.com` or
  `*.example.com`. Changing this creates a new domain.

* `server` - (Required, List) Specifies an array of origin web servers. The object structure is documented below.

* `certificate_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the certificate ID. This parameter is mandatory when `client_protocol`
  is set to HTTPS.

* `certificate_name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the certificate name. This parameter is mandatory
  when `client_protocol` is set to HTTPS.

* `policy_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the policy ID associated with the domain. If not specified, a new
  policy will be created automatically. Changing this create a new domain.

* `keep_policy` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to retain the policy when deleting a domain name.
  Defaults to true.
  
* `proxy` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether a proxy is configured.

* `charging_mode` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the charging mode of the domain. Valid values are *prePaid*
  and *postPaid*, defaults to *prePaid*. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the enterprise project ID of WAF domain.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `custom_page` - (Optional, List) The user-defined alarm configuration is displayed after an error occurs. The object structure is documented below.

* `http2_enable` - (Optional, Bool) HTTP2 is only available for client to WAF access.
  Precautions for use:
    路 The external protocol of at least one source IP address is set to HTTPS in Server Configuration. 
      This configuration takes effect only when it is enabled.
    路 HTTP2 does not take effect when the client supports TLS 1.3.
    路 HTTP2 takes effect only when the client supports TLS 1.2.
    路 If the customer has mandatory requirements for HTTP2, use exclusive mode.

* `ipv6_enable` - (Optional, Bool) Enable IPv6 Protection if the domain name is accessible using an IPv6 address. After you enable it, WAF assigns an IPv6 address to the domain name.

* `timeout_settings` - (Optional, List) Generally, the connection timeout does not need to be changed.
  Read/write timeout may be adjusted according to different service requirements.
  It is recommended that services be asynchronous to avoid large timeouts.
  A large timeout configuration consumes long connection resources back to the source and
  may cause slow connection attacks. The WAF has a quota for the long link back of each domain name.
  For details about the quota, see Service bandwidth information on the Purchase page.
  The object structure is documented below.

The `server` block supports:

* `client_protocol` - (Required, String) Protocol type of the client. The options include `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* `server_protocol` - (Required, String) Protocol used by WAF to forward client requests to the server. The options
  include `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* `address` - (Required, String) IP address or domain name of the web server that the client accesses. For example,
  `192.168.1.1` or `www.a.com`.

* `port` - (Required, Int) Port number used by the web server. The value ranges from 0 to 65535,
  for example, 8080.

the `custom_page` block supports:

* `http_return_code` - (Required, String) The status code returned when an error is reported. For example,
`400` or `402`.

* `block_page_type` - (Required, String) "Custom alert page" content type. This value can be :
  **text/html**, **text/xml**, **application/json**.

* `page_content` - (Required, String) Set the page content based on the selected "block-page-type".
  The following example is based on block-page-type "application/json".
  ```{
    "event_id": "$${waf_event_id}",
    "error_msg": "error message"
  }```

the `timeout_settings` block supports:

* `connection_timeout` - (Optional, Int) Timeout configuration for WAF connection to the source station.

* `read_timeout` - (Optional, Int) The WAF sends a request to the source timeout configuration.

* `write_timeout` - (Optional, Int) WAF receiving source response timeout configuration.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the domain.

* `protect_status` - The WAF mode. -1: bypassed, 0: disabled, 1: enabled.

* `access_status` - Whether a domain name is connected to WAF. 0: The domain name is not connected to WAF, 1: The domain
  name is connected to WAF.

* `protocol` - The protocol type of the client. The options are HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP&HTTPS.

## Import

There are two ways to import WAF domain state.

* Using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_waf_domain.test <id>
```

* Using `id` and `enterprise_project_id`, separated by a slash, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_waf_domain.test <id>/<enterprise_project_id>
```
