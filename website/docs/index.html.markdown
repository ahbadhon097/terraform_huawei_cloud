# HuaweiCloud Provider

The HuaweiCloud provider is used to interact with the
many resources supported by HuaweiCloud. The provider needs to be configured
with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the HuaweiCloud Provider
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region      = "cn-north-1"
  domain_name = "my-account-name"
  access_key  = "my-access-key"
  secret_key  = "my-secret-key"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "huaweicloud_vpc_v1" "example" {
  name = "my_vpc"
  cidr = "192.168.0.0/16"
}
```

## Authentication

The Huawei Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for
authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and
explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

### Static credentials ###

!> **Warning:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not
recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `access_key` and `secret_key`
in-line in the provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region      = "cn-north-1"
  domain_name = "my-account-name"
  access_key  = "my-access-key"
  secret_key  = "my-secret-key"
}
```
-> **NOTE:** `domain_name`, [Account name](https://support.huaweicloud.com/en-us/usermanual-iam/iam_01_0552.html) need to be set if using IAM or prePaid resources.


By adding `user_name` and `password`:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region      = "cn-north-1"
  domain_name = "my-account-name"
  user_name   = "my-username"
  password    = "my-password"
}
```
-> **NOTE:** `domain_name` is required here.

By adding `token`:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region      = "cn-north-1"
  domain_name = "my-account-name"
  token       = "my-token"
}
```


Delegating Resource Access to Another Account by adding `agency_name`, `agency_domain_name` and `delegated_project`:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  agency_name        = "agency-name"
  agency_domain_name = "agency-domain-name"

  region      = "cn-north-1"
  domain_name = "my-account-name"
  user_name   = "my-username"
  password    = "my-password"
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via the `OS_ACCESS_KEY` and
`OS_SECRET_KEY`, environment variables, representing your Huawei
Cloud Access Key and Secret Key, respectively.
The `OS_USERNAME` and `OS_PASSWORD` environment variables
are also used, if applicable:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export OS_ACCESS_KEY="anaccesskey"
$ export OS_SECRET_KEY="asecretkey"
$ export OS_REGION_NAME="cn-north-1"
$ export OS_DOMAIN_NAME="account-name"
$ terraform plan
```
